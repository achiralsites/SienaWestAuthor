title: Get to Know Siena
---
_Siena West is the pen name of a professional archaeologist with decades of experience. She spent most of her professional life writing what were—let’s face it—boring technical reports. Her transition to fiction was a natural outgrowth from the five books on Southwest archaeology she wrote for a nonprofessional audience. Her passion is bringing the past to life by telling intriguing stories, developing engaging characters, and setting her novels in the captivating Southwest. Siena’s writing interweaves stories about ancient Native Americans with modern-day mysteries in a seamless telling of tales. _

_Siena divides her time between two homes in Arizona. One is in the pine-forested mountains, and the other is in the hot, thorny desert. She also is an artist who works in mosaics, fiber arts, and acrylic painting. _
